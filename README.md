Galini Solar Well Project

This Project is about solar panels charging some batteries and pumping
water uphill to a storage pool. It makes use of a Raspberry Pi running
Raspbian and some custom electronics.

I have no idea whether this is useful for anyone else but maybe *you*
were just looking for exactly this bit in your own project ;)
