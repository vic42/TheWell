Galini Solar Well Project

This Project is about solar panels charging some batteries and pumping
water uphill to a storage pool. It makes use of a Raspberry Pi running
Raspbian and some custom electronics.

I have no idea whether this is useful for anyone else but maybe *you*
were just looking for exactly this bit in your own project ;)

A strong word of *WARNING*:

All of the scripts contained in this project lack all of the well-known security provisions but rather combine all of the worst practices of script security. Such system should therefore *never be exposed to a public internet connection*. A malicious person or robot who gains access to the web server can *easily take over your pi* and integrate it into their botnet -- at best. So please take this project as a *technology demonstrator* rather than a finished product.

Vic.
